# Bangalore: Vaccination Slot Opening Insights

The Indian Government opened the vaccination drive for people older than 18 years on the 1st of May. Given the huge shortage of vaccines and the vast number of people trying to get a slot on the CoWin portal, the experience has been far from ideal. However, people have rightly used their technology prowess to build bots that send alerts as soon as hospitals open up slots on Twitter/Telegram. While there are thousands of people getting these alerts, less than 5% of the people actually successfully book a slot. This leaves the rest frustrated considering the amount of time they have spent in trying to get a slot.

Pondering over this problem, I thought maybe I could figure out when most of the slots are usually opened by Hospitals. I put my skills in python to use by web scraping the @BlrVaccine Twitter handle and collected data for each hospital on when they usually open slots. I built a dashboard using Tableau and was pleasantly surprised about my findings:
1. Your chances of finding a slot is high between 7-8 PM and 10-11 PM
2. Manipal Clinic opens its slots around 5 PM
